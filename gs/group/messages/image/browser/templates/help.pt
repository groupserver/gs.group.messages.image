  <h3>Images</h3>
  <p>An image posted to a group is shown on an 
    <cite>image page</cite>.
    This page provides a view of the posted image that is smaller.
    Smaller images take less time to download, and view.
    In this section the different parts of the page are detailed â€”
    starting with the page title, the navigation bar, the share bar,
    the image itself, and finally the information about the image.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The title</strong> of the image is shown at the top of the
    page, just beneath the standard navigation elements.
    The title comes from the name given to the file by the person
    who posted it to the group.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The navigation bar</strong> is used to go between the
    other images posted to the same topic, or the message that was
    posted at the same time as the image.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Click <samp class="link">Previous image</samp> to see the 
        image that was posted before the one you are currently 
        viewing.</li>
      <li>Click <samp class="link">Post</samp> to view the full post 
        that was added to the group, including the message.
      <li>Click <samp class="link">Next image</samp> to see the image
        that was posted before the one you are viewing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>The share bar</strong> allows you to share the image with
    others.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The image itself</strong> is possibly smaller than the 
    image that was origianlly posted.
    The image shown on the image page has a maximum size of <strong>598
      by 407 pixels</strong> (dots).
    <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
    If the original image was bigger than this then it will be reduced
    in size to fit on the image page.
    Clicking on the image, or <samp class="link">Full sized image</samp> 
    will show the original image, at its original size.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, <strong>additional information</strong> (metadata) about
    the image is shown to the right of the page.
    This will help you determine some of the 
    <em class="wordasword">context</em> of the image.
    The information is as follows.
